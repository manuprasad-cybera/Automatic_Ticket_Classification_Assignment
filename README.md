# Automatic Ticket Classification using NLP

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for an NLP project on Automatic Ticket Classification. The project focuses on classifying unstructured textual data, specifically tickets, into structured categories using various NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms.


## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Tokenization
   - Text cleaning (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
   - Vectorization (converting text data into numerical format)

2. **Model Training**:
   - Experimentation with various classification algorithms:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Naive Bayes

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluation metrics:
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-score
     - Accuracy

4. **Results Analysis**:
   - Analysis of model performance and comparison of different algorithms.
